### Run Database Migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### Getting started

**Compile CSS and JS** (Optional)

_The Bootstrap and Vue scaffolding provided by Laravel as of version 6.0 is now located in the [`laravel/ui`](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/frontend) Composer package._

_Laravel 8 has shifted the official **Authentication** support to [`Laravel/Fortify`](https://github.com/laravel/fortify). This package is still scaffolding auth based off the `laravel/ui` but we intend to catch up ASAP._

Note: This should only be done for fresh installations.

```bash
composer require laravel/ui

php artisan ui bootstrap

# php artisan ui bootstrap --auth

npm install && npm run dev
```

**Serve application**

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/{guard}
```

### Extras

**Check guards**

```php
$ php artisan tinker
...
>>> config('auth.guards');
```

**Access guard instance:**

Specify the guard instance you would like to use, eg using `admin` guard...

```php
Auth::guard('admin')->user();
```

**Check routes:** 

To find out which routes have been created for your guard.

```bash
php artisan route:list
```

**Email verification:** 

You may require users to verify their email addresses before using the application. 
Read the [wiki](https://github.com/mtvbrianking/multi-auth/wiki/Email-Verification) on how to enable this.
